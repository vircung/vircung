Hi!

So here we go again with blog. But this time is diffrent.

It'll be written in english rather than in native like [before][old-blog]. Not only for fun but mostly to improve my english writing. Who knows when this will be helpfull.

Second change will be that all content is public in repository at [GitHub][github]. So if you notice something wierd you know what do to :)

Let curiosity kill the cat and go on a new journey.
