Yeah, that's pretty much it when you try to find topic to speak about. Especially when you try to find it by yourself. But hey, you're not lone isnald. It's ok to snag an idea or two from someone's else blog. That's because you'll use diffrent point of view on the topic. It's called inspiration. And that's how i came up with this subject that i'll try to push to few places.

### Thoughts of inexerienced person about experience

This came to me after reading some blog posts:

* [about pet projects][about-pet-projects] which gave me direction to think about gaining experience
* [inspire and get inspired][inspire-and-get-inspired] that gave me some courage to search for conferences with CFP
* [why you should speak at meetups andconferences][why-you-should-speak-at-meetups-andconferences] that actually forced me to send those submissions

Questions that started going back and forth my mind are not so trivial:

* what's wrong with 'xyz years of experience in ...' that is seen in job offers
* why (sometimes) '5 years of experience' is not what it sounds like
* when do you really get experience
* how it's diffrent from expertise
* can you 'store' experience and how to do it

... and so on and so forth. You can multiple this kind of questions.

### Where it comes from

In my opinion definetly not from you dayjob. Dayjob is outcome of your experience, i'll talk about it later. The real source is passion and fun. If you're passionate about something you're eager to learn about it, play with it and gather information. I can bet on that there were numerous situations that you would rather search for inforamtion about new library that you found than spend time on tasks that are boring to you.

There is (at least in my opinion) big diffrence between 'i need to know' and 'i want to know'. Let's give an simple example: kids. They way more prefer to play thier favourite game (digital or manual) or even watch that someone's plays it over doing boring homerowk. Of course there are exceptions that just enjoy school activities. Same is with you and me and everyone else. We are like kids. And this won't change.
