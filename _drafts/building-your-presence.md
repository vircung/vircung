tl;dr

I share my story and plans for this year.

Go on ...
---

Have you been on any conference, meetup, barcamp or else? I've attended some. What do you think about people that speaks at those meetings? Super-duper-guru at some field? Or maby they achived incredible success? Or have amazing career? I belive for some answer is 'yes', for others is 'maby' and there is group with 'no' answer. Are you amazed? I tought so :)

What's the diffrence between you and them? It's really easy. It's a the same time **no biggy** deal and **oh my god what the hell** problem. This is all about stepping outside of your comfort zone. Yeah that's all.

That's because if you do this you'll expose yourself for whole new kind of expirience. I can assure that at the beginning it can be scary but it's really not. You can do small steps but you need to remember to always push your comfort zone a little bit every time. The key part is that you need to be **consistent**.

How we (I) do this
---

Blog
===

The most simplest way to start doing this (in my opinion of course) is to start a blog. There is a lot of free platforms that you might use. Simple ones like [Wordpress][wordpress], [Blogger][blogger], [Tumblr][tumblr] and a little bit more advanced like [GitHub pages][github] and much much more advanced that need server, setup and other stuff.

Actually that was the way I started to show myself. At first I created [personal blog][wordpress-vircung] where I put some of my toughts. I think all of those posts were shared by me on Facebook and Twitter to get bigger audience. Then I had an idea to try to reach bigger public so I put few post on [dobreprogramy][dobreprogramy-vircung]. I've got some views and even replies. YAY for me!

Sadly both of them are kind of abandoned becouse of my lack of self discipline. What amazed me the most is that even after almost 2 eyars of inactivity I got around 100 views per month on wordpress. If you affraid of criticism you don't need to put personal informations about you, at least doesn't put any fake ones.

Meetings
===

As I said at the beginning there are meetings too like conferences or local groups. They are everywhere and you should definetly attend them. I was on local meetings like [LubCamp][lubcap] wich I ust attended, [Hackerspace Lublin][hackerspace-lbn], [KUL.net][kul-net] wich I speak at or [LDI][ldi] wich I helped to organize. If you think there's nothing going on in you neighbour go check again I can bet that there is something. You need to search harder.

From my point of view the most valuable and scare expirience was speaking at those meetings. The reason is (i think) obvious. I had to express myself and topic that I choosed in most fluent way that I could. This wasn't that how I wanted. There was lots of _eee's_, _yyy's', _mmm's_ and so on. But hey I did it and i'm alive! So it's possible! And also there was possibility that there could be questions to answer which they were and which were answered by me.

But I need to confess i gave one answer **Hmm, I don't know, sorry. But catch me later we'll figure it out together**. It was very unconfortable to me to say that and this disturbed me for quite a while. But hey, nobody's perfect and nobody knows answerts from the beginning.

The topics
===

One of blockers for me to start doing this was topics. I just didn't know what to speak or write about. I envied people that write posts out of thin air. It was hard for me to find something to write about. But you know what it is possible. As a developer, programmer or whatever you call yourself you always learn something new, you always step on and solve problems. You can even write about you [hobby][hobby] :)
